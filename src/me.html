            <p> Since I was young, I always was mesmerized by the way some people could use mathmatics to explain the world around us.
                I have come to the realization that what really intrigued me was their creativity.
                So fuelled by a taste of the imagination of great woman and man throughout fields such as mathmatics, physics and engineering, I have decided to willingly take this path of discovery and study.

            <p>The CryptoSummer was a summer project about cryptocurrencies and blockchain. I had my first real exposure to blockchain technology and 
            the ecosystem which flourished with the birth of the first cryptocurrency. Our project was aimed towards the solid waste menagement, basically the idea is to reward 
            people for separating and recycling solid urban waste and the reward would come in the form of a digital currency. Check more about the project and give feedback on our pitch!</p>
